# Remindbot
Remindbot is a simple and small bot that reminds you on pre-defined dates. We use it to be reminded of expiring contracts. It's not really meant to be used in a broader context, but feel free to suggest changes if it would make it more universally usable that way.

It offers the following features:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Overview | Outputs a reminders overview. |
| Reminder | Outputs only relevant reminders. |

Aside from features, there are also different methods that can be used with the features:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| CLI | Feature feedback or output on the CLI. |
| Telegram | Feature feedback or output to a Telegram bot. |

# Install remindbot
Easy! But before you download software, always check its source code and/or credibility. Never trust random people on the internet ;-). If you are particularly gullible or like living on the edge, you can also skip this. To install, download [`remindbot.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nozel-org/remindbot/stable/remindbot.sh) and place it in `/usr/bin/remindbot`. You can add the configuration file and reminders file to respectively `/etc/remindbot/remindbot.conf` and `/etc/remindbot/reminders.txt`.

Please note that you will need `wget` for automated retrieval of reminder lists.
